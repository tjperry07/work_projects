# BigCommerce Work Portfolio

At BigCommerce I was tasked with doing a full revamp of the BigCommerce developer site. This included rewriting all existing documentation, creating new spec files ,and finding a system that would work for both writers and the company. This meant working across the company with engineering, support ,and our developer advocate to create the best possible experience. As of May 31, 2020, that foundation is still in place.

Some of the work that I completed included:

* Rewrite of all developer documentation
* Creating new content to get the documentation up to date
* Rewriting API spec files
* Creating missing spec files
* Create site information architecture
* Figure out if the company should build a solution or go with a SaaS solution
* Writing and testing code for the documentation
* Verifying the accuracy of specification files

I have included several writing samples and specification files.
