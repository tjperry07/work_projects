## Widgets

Widgets are added to Screens to display log metrics. 

There are four different widget types:

- **Count** - Displays a single aggregate number.
- **Gauge** - Displays a count out of a minimum and maximum value using a gauge indicator.
- **Table** - Displays a horizontal bar chart with logs grouped by a selectable field.
- **Time Shifted Graph** - Displays a layered line graph comparing values over two different periods. For example, log volume today vs. log volume yesterday.

## Feature Notes

- Screens can only accommodate a certain number of widgets. Click and drag widgets to adjust size or create a new Screen.
