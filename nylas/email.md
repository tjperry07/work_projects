-   [Use the Email Component with Nylas Data](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#use-the-email-component-with-nylas-data) - Choose this option if you want to integrate your existing Nylas accounts with the Email Component.
-   [Use the Email Component with External Data](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#use-email-component-with-external-data) - Choose this option if you want to pass in your data.

### Use the Email Component with Nylas Data[](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#use-the-email-component-with-nylas-data)

You'll learn how to use your Nylas accounts with the Email Component.

#### Create the Email Component[](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#create-the-email-component)

1.  Log in to your [Nylas Dashboard](https://dashboard.nylas.com/applications/app).
2.  In your [Components tab](https://dashboard.nylas.com/applications/app/components), click **Email**.
3.  Name your Component and select the account. To quickly start testing your Component select **Enable for a single account.**
    1.  To learn how to enable components for multiple accounts see [Authorizing Components](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#authorizing-components).
4.  Use an existing access token or generate a new one.
5.  Enter the [domain](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#domain-restriction) the component will run on. Without the [domains](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#domain-restriction) the component will not run.
    1.  To run on localhost, enter an asterisk. `*`. Remember to change this before going to production.
6.  Save your new component.
7.  On the **Edit** page, you can configure your component behavior and appearance.

**Generate an Access Token**

Generating a new access token will not replace your existing access token; it will create a second access token with the same scopes as the previous token. You can [revoke access tokens](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/api/#get/oauth/authorizerevoke) at any time.

### Add the Component To Your Application[](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#add-the-component-to-your-application)

Before you add the Component to your application, you can either choose a thread ID in the dashboard or you can pass in a message ID or thread ID directly into the Email Component.

#### Dashboard Thread ID[](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#dashboard-thread-id)

1.  On the **Edit** page, there are instructions for installing the new component.
2.  Make sure to select which **Thread to view**.
3.  If you haven't installed the Email Component already, open a terminal and run `npm i @nylas/components-email`.
4.  Then add your Nylas component. Copy and paste your component code into your application. `<nylas-email id="your-email-id" > </nylas-email>`
5.  You should refresh your application if needed. Any [configuration options](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#nylas-dashboard-display-options) set on the editing page will apply to your Component.

#### API Message and Thread ID[](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#api-message-and-thread-id)

1.  On the **Edit** page, there are instructions for installing the new component.
    
2.  If you haven't installed the Email Component already, open a terminal and run `npm i @nylas/components-email`.
    
3.  Then add your Nylas component. Copy and paste your component code into your application. `<nylas-email id="your-email-id" > </nylas-email>`
    
4.  Leave **Thread to view** empty.
    
5.  Then either pass in a [thread](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/api/#get/threads) or [message](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/api/#get/messages) ID.
    
    ```
        <nylas-email id="<NYLAS_COMPONENT_ID>" thread_id="<THREAD_ID"></nylas-email>    //or    <nylas-email id="<NYLAS_COMPONENT_ID>" message_id="<MESSAGE_ID>"></nylas-email>   
    ```
    
6.  You should refresh your application if needed. Any [configuration options](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#nylas-dashboard-display-options) set on the editing page will apply to your Component.
    

### Use Email Component with External Data[](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#use-email-component-with-external-data)

You'll learn how to pass threads and messages to display an email thread within your application.

1.  Install the Nylas Email Component. `npm i @nylas/components-email`.

The Nylas Email Component can accept a [Nylas Thread object](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/api/#tag--Threads--thread-object) or a [Nylas Message object](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/api/#tag--Messages--message-object).

You can pass in:

-   `thread` - A thread of one or more messages
-   `message` - A single message

With components, you can authorize them to work with a single account or multiple accounts.

### Enable for a Single Account[](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#enable-for-a-single-account)

A single account is a way to get started quickly. If you use this method in production, you'll have to authenticate each account from the dashboard one by one.

![Enable components single account](https://nylas-static-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public-documentation/components_enable_single_account.png)

### Enable for All Accounts[](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#enable-for-all-accounts)

To enable all accounts, you'll need to pass in a user's access token as a property of the component. One way to achieve this is to create a login screen, capture the access token and pass it into the component. You can pass in `access_tokens` directly in the Component.

`<nylas-agenda id="COMPONENT-ID" access_token="USER-ACCESS-TOKEN"/>`

Make sure to keep `access_tokens` hidden and never expose them online.

![Enable Components for all accounts](https://nylas-static-assets.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/public-documentation/components_enable_all_accounts.png)

**Dashboard Preview**

Dashboard previews do not work when enabling for all accounts.

## Customization[](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#customization)

Nylas Components are flexible and can be customized for your needs.

### Allowed Domains[](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#allowed-domains)

You can restrict the domains that your Component works on. Use glob patterns to enable or disable domains.

Some examples of glob patterns:

-   `nylas.com` will only match [nylas.com](http://nylas.com/)
-   `subdomain.nylas.com` will match `subdomain.nylas.com`
-   `*subdomain.nylas.com` will match `subdomain.nylas.com` and `sub.sub.subdomain.nylas.com`
-   `*` will match any domain

Domain restriction only applies to the domain name. URL paths (/sub-path) or protocols (HTTPS) can not be restricted.

### How Properties Are Handled[](https://developer.nylas.com/docs/user-experience/components/email-component/#how-properties-are-handled)

Nylas Components follow an order of operations to decide if the dashboard or code takes precedence.

1.  If the property **is** passed directly to the Component, use that first.
2.  If the property **is not** passed directly in the Component, use the dashboard settings.
3.  If there are **no properties** set in the Component or the dashboard, use the Component defaults.
