# Nylas Work Porfolio

At Nylas, I was hired as the only technical writer. My job was to do an audit and rewrite of the existing documentation, create OKRs, hire a team, and build out a new documentation portal. Some of the work completed included:

- Writing documentation for almost all major releases
- Rewriting all authentication documentation
- Hiring a team
- Hiring contractors to build documentation site and help with on-going documentation efforts
- Automation basic checks like grammar, image sizing, and links
- Creating team OKRs
- Writing job levels from Tech Writer I to Lead Technical Writer

# Code Samples

I created most of the code samples for the documentation including API, front end applications, and managing Postman.
